    🧱 Tkinter – GUI library used to build interactive user interfaces.

    🛠️ Ttk (Themed Tkinter Widgets) – For enhanced button and layout styling.

🗣️ pyttsx3 – Offline Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine to provide voice feedback for user actions.

📊 matplotlib – Visualization library used to generate bar and pie charts for spending analysis.

📄 ReportLab – Library for generating PDF statements of user transactions.

📂 os, filedialog – Used for file system interactions and downloading PDF files.

🔐 simpledialog, messagebox – For secure PIN entry and alert messages.

✔️ Git & GitHub – Version control and code hosting platform.

🧠 Project Overview
A simulated Smart ATM GUI System designed to mimic real ATM functionality including account access, secure PIN validation, transaction management, statement generation, and voice interaction.

🛠️ Core Functionalities
🔐 Multi-User Card System:

Users can select from predefined cardholders like Rajesh Malhotra, Mushkaan Mohanta, and Suhani Singh.

🧾 Secure PIN Verification:

Prompts users to securely enter their PIN before accessing dashboard functionalities.

💵 Transaction Capabilities:

Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can deposit or withdraw any valid amount.

Live balance update after each transaction.

📈 Visual Spending Reports:

Generates bar and pie charts comparing total deposits vs. withdrawals using matplotlib.

📄 PDF Statement Generation:

Transaction history can be exported and downloaded as a PDF using ReportLab.

📜 Recent Transactions Viewer:

Dashboard displays the 5 most recent transactions dynamically.

🗣️ Voice Assistant:

Each transaction triggers a speech response using pyttsx3 for a more interactive experience.

🤖 ChatBot Support:

A mock chatbot help system provides on-screen assistance and guidance.

🎨 Beautiful GUI:

Organized using Tkinter Frames with color-coded sections, consistent typography, and stylized widgets.
